```kotlin
val config = WifiConfiguration().apply {
    SSID = "\"${network.ssid}\""
    // Enhanced security configuration for WPA/WPA2/WEP
    when {
        capabilities.contains("WPA") -> {
            allowedKeyManagement.set(WifiConfiguration.KeyMgmt.WPA_PSK)
            preSharedKey = "\"$password\""
