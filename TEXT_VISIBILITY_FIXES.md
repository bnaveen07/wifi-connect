# Text Visibility Improvements - Fixed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WiFi Manager Service Card

- **Problem**: Grey highlighted text with poor contrast
- **Solution**:
  - Added conditional text colors based on service state
  - Active service uses `onPrimaryContainer` colors for better contrast
  - Inactive service uses `onSurfaceVariant` with enhanced visibility
  - Icons also get appropriate color contrast

### 2. Connection Status Card

- **Problem**: Grey text difficult to read
- **Solution**:
  - Changed card background from `surface` to `surfaceVariant` for better contrast
  - Updated status text to use `onSurfaceVariant` instead of dynamic status colors
  - Made connected network name bold for better visibility
  - Enhanced signal strength text with better opacity levels

### 3. Network Cards

- **Problem**: Poor text contrast on highlighted networks
- **Solution**:
  - Conditional text colors for different network states:
    - Connected networks: `onPrimaryContainer`
    - Saved networks: `onSecondaryContainer`
    - Regular networks: `onSurface`
  - Enhanced signal strength text with contextual colors
  - Improved security chip backgrounds (increased alpha from 0.1 to 0.15)
  - Made security text bold for better readability
  - Enhanced connection score visibility with better contrast

### 4. Settings Icons

- **Problem**: Settings icon not clearly visible
- **Solution**:
  - Added conditional icon colors matching the card state
  - Active service: `onPrimaryContainer`
  - Inactive service: `onSurfaceVariant`

## Color Scheme Improvements

### Before (Issues):

- Grey highlighted text was hard to read
- Inconsistent color usage across components

- Status indicators blending with background

### After (Fixed):

- ✅ Proper contrast ratios for all text elements
- ✅ Conditional colors based on component state
- ✅ Enhanced visibility in both light and dark modes
- ✅ Bold text for important information
- ✅ Better alpha values for background elements
